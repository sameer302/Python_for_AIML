# for loop is used for sequential access. for e.g., to access 
# elements of a list, tuple, string, etc.

# list = [1,2,3,4,5]
# for val in list:
#     print(val)

# tup = ("sam","jack","cash","vash")
# for name in tup:
#     print(name)

# str = "sameer"
# for char in str:
#     print(char)

# no char data type in python, characters are treated as string of 
# length 1 hence char is not a keyword in python


# list = [1,2,3,4,5]
# for el in list:
#     if(el == 3):
#         break
#     print(el)
# else:
#     print("end of list") # not printed

# list = [1,2,3,4,5]
# for el in list:
#     if(el == 3):
#         break
#     print(el)
# print("end of list") # printed

# pass statement: it is a null statement that does nothing.
# used as a placeholder for future code
# for el in range(10):

# print("some useful work") # error

# for el in range(10):
#     pass

# print("some useful work") # no error

# pass can also be used in methods

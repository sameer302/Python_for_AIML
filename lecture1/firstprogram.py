''' We need high-level languages because they offer **greater abstraction, performance, and flexibility** than scripting languages. 
While scripting is ideal for automating system tasks, high-level languages enable **complex logic, data structures, cross-platform development, 
and direct hardware interaction**. Theyâ€™re essential for building scalable applications, optimizing performance, and leveraging rich ecosystems of
libraries and tools.'''

# first program

# here print is a function which takes hello world string as input and displays it on console as output

# both java and python are portable languages but java is slightly more portable as compare to python.
# in case of python there may be issues in working of some libraries and also issue with respect to version of python being used.
# python is interpreted language while java is compiled into bytecode.

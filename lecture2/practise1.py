# # Q1) WAP to input user's first name and print its length. 
# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# print("length of your name is:", len(name))

# Q2) WAP to count the occurence of '$' in a string
# string = input("Enter the word: ")
# print("number of occurences of $ are:",string.count("$"))
# in case of input() function, it does not consider empty space as input separator and instead considers it as a part of the string.
# It's just like the difference between scanf() and get() functions in C
